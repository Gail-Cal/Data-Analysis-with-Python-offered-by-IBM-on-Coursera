# Data-Analysis-with-Python-offered-by-IBM-on-Coursera

This repository contains all my hands-on lab on the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate offered by IBM on Coursera.

The hands-on experience from the said course together with video lessons helped me to understand and deal with :
1. Importing Data Sets.
2. Data Wrangling.
3. Explanatory Data Analysis.
4. Model Development
5. Model Evaluation.
